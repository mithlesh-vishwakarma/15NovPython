Polymorphism:
- poly refers many.
- single interface having multiple implementations
- there must be the parameters different types.
- Polymorphism means one name, many forms.
  In C++, it allows the same function or operator to behave differently based on how it is used.


There are two types of polymorphism :

1. compile time (Static polymorphism) : 1. function overloading && 2. operator overoading
2. run time  (dynamic polymorphism)   : 1. function overriding  && 2. operator overriding
