Polymorphism:
- poly refers many.
- single interface having multiple implementations
- there must be the parameters different types.
- Polymorphism means one name, many forms.
  In C++, it allows the same function or operator to behave differently based on how it is used.


There are two types of polymorphism :

1. compile time (Static polymorphism) : 1. function overloading && 2. operator overoading
2. run time  (dynamic polymorphism)   : 1. function overriding  && 2. operator overriding


1. Function overloading:
------------------------
same function name but it behave based on variable's data type and number of parameter. it is called function overloading.

2. operator overloading: 
------------------------
single operators which is used to perform two or more operands. this is called operator overloading.

3. function overriding:
-----------------------

virtual function:
-----------------
a virtual function can be defined as the member function within a base class which you expect to redefine in derived classes.
for creating a virtual function, you have to precede your function's declaration within the base class with a virtual keyword.


Pure Virtual Function :
---------------------
A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no definition in the base class and is declared using = 0.


Why Abstract Class is Used
----------------------------
To define a common interface for derived classes
To force derived classes to implement specific functions
To achieve runtime polymorphism
To design loosely coupled and scalable code
