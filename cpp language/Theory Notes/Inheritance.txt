INHERITANCE (C++)

Definition:
Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept in which a new class (derived class)
acquires the properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) of an existing
class (base class). It helps in code reuse, extensibility, and logical organization of programs.

Why Inheritance is Used (Uses of Inheritance):

1. Code Reusability:
   Existing class code can be reused in new classes, reducing duplication and saving development time.

2. Extensibility:
   New features can be added to a program without modifying the existing code.

3. Better Maintainability:
   Changes made in the base class automatically reflect in derived classes, making maintenance easier.

4. Logical Hierarchy:
   Inheritance helps represent real-world relationships such as parent-child or general-specific.

5. Faster Development:
   Developers can build applications quickly by reusing tested and reliable code.

6. Improved Readability:
   Code becomes more organized and easier to understand due to structured class relationships.

7. Supports Polymorphism:
   Inheritance allows function overriding, enabling runtime polymorphism.

Example:
   A class "Student" can inherit from a class "Person" because a student is a person.

Syntax Example:
   class DerivedClass : public BaseClass
   {
       // members of derived class
   };


TYPES OF INHERITANCE (C++)

1. Single Inheritance:
   In single inheritance, one derived class inherits from only one base class.

   Syntax Example:
   class A
   {
       // data members and member functions
   };

   class B : public A
   {
       // inherits properties of class A
   };


2. Multiple Inheritance:
   In multiple inheritance, one derived class inherits from more than one base class.

   Syntax Example:
   class A
   {
       // members of class A
   };

   class B
   {
       // members of class B
   };

   class C : public A, public B
   {
       // inherits from both A and B
   };


3. Multilevel Inheritance:
   In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class.

   Syntax Example:
   class A
   {
       // base class
   };

   class B : public A
   {
       // derived from A
   };

   class C : public B
   {
       // derived from B
   };


4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
   In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

   Syntax Example:
   class A
   {
       // base class
   };

   class B : public A
   {
       // derived class 1
   };

   class C : public A
   {
       // derived class 2
   };


5. Hybrid Inheritance:
   Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

   Syntax Example:
   class A
   {
       // base class
   };

   class B : public A
   {
       // derived from A
   };

   class C : public A
   {
       // derived from A
   };

   class D : public B, public C
   {
       // hybrid inheritance
   };
