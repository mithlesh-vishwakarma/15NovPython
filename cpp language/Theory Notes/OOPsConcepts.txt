What is OOPS in C++?
--------------------------------------
Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects and classes, instead of only functions and logic.
C++ is a fully object-oriented language (except a few C-style features).

OOPS helps in:
------------------------
Better code organization
Reusability
Security
Easy maintenance
Real-world problem modeling


1. Class
------------
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines data members (variables) and member functions (methods).

Example idea:
Class = Design of a house
Object = Actual house built from that design

2. Object
-------------
An object is a real instance of a class.
It represents real-world entities and occupies memory.

Key point:
-------------
Class does not occupy memory
Object occupies memory

3. Encapsulation
-------------------
Encapsulation means binding data and functions together into a single unit (class).

Why important?
----------------
Protects data from direct access
Improves security

This is achieved using access specifiers:
---------------------------------------
private
protected
public

4. Abstraction
------------------
Abstraction means showing only essential details and hiding internal implementation.

Real-life example:
You drive a car using steering, brake, accelerator
You don’t need to know engine internals

In C++, abstraction is achieved using:
------------------------------------------
Classes
Access specifiers
Abstract classes (using pure virtual functions)

5. Inheritance
---------------------
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behavior of another class.

Why use inheritance?
---------------------
Code reusability
Faster development
Better structure

Types of inheritance in C++:
----------------------------
Single
Multiple
Multilevel
Hierarchical
Hybrid

6. Polymorphism
---------------------
Polymorphism means one name, many forms.

There are two types:
---------------------
a) Compile-time Polymorphism
-----------------------------
Function Overloading

Operator Overloading


b) Runtime Polymorphism
------------------------

Function Overriding

Achieved using virtual functions

7. Dynamic Binding
-------------------------
Dynamic binding means function calls are resolved at runtime, not compile time.

Used with:
------------------
Base class pointer

Virtual functions

8. Message Passing
--------------------------
Objects communicate with each other by calling methods, known as message passing.
