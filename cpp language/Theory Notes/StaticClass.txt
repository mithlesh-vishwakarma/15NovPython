What is a “Static Class” (Concept):
-----------------------------------
A static class is a class whose objects cannot be created and whose members are accessed directly using the class name.

Why Static Class Concept is Used:
----------------------------------
- To group utility functions
- To share common data
- To avoid object creation
- For global-like functionality with class structure


2. Static Data Member in C++:
-----------------------------
Definition:
-----------
A static data member is a class variable that is shared by all objects of the class.


Characteristics:
-----------------
- Only one copy exists
- Memory allocated once
- Declared inside class, defined outside
- Accessed using class name



3. Static Member Function in C++:
--------------------------------
Definition:
A static member function belongs to the class, not to any object.
It can access only static data members of the class.

Why Static Member Function is Used:
----------------------------------
- Operates on class-level data
- No need to create objects
- Better memory usage
- Used for utility methods


Rules of Static Member Function:
---------------------------------
- Can access only static members
- Cannot use this pointer
- Called using ClassName::function()
- Exists even if no object is created





5. One-Line Exam Definitions:
-----------------------------
Static Data Member:-- A variable shared by all objects of a class.

Static Member Function:-- A function that belongs to the class and accesses only static members.

Static Class (Concept):-- A class with only static members and no object creation.

----------------------------------------------------------
| Normal Member Function | Static Member Function         |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Requires object        | No object required             |
| Can access all members | Can access only static members |
| Uses `this` pointer    | No `this` pointer              |
| Object based           | Class based                    |
